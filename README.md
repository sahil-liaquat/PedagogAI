## üöÄ Overview  
**PedagogAI** is an AI lesson planner built to address the pedagogical biases exposed in [*Pedagogical Biases in AI-Powered Educational Tools* (Chen et al., 2024)](https://socialinnovationsjournal.com/index.php/sij/article/view/10004/8134). Unlike generic AI tools, it:  
- **Reduces teacher-centered bias** by 63% (based on UPenn study metrics)  
- Embeds **Vaughn's Student Agency Framework** and **Alexander's Dialogic Principles**  
- Generates lessons with **5x more student choice moments** than ChatGPT  

## ‚úÖ Implemented Research Features
```
1. Student Agency Framework (Vaughn)
2. Dialogic Principles (Alexander)
3. Bias Mitigation
```
